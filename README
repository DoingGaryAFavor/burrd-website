How to Deploy the Website to the Server
by Sherman

Prerequisites:
- The latest production version of the website has been pulled onto the local
	machine

1. Build the website into a tar ball.  On the local machine, change to the
        burrd-website directory and run the command:

        $> meteor build burrd-website


2. Transfer the newly generated tar ball to the remote server.  The tar ball
        should be in the folder 
	burrd-website/burrd-website/burrd-website.tar.gz

        Use the following command to transfer the tar ball:

        $> scp burrd-website.tar.gz sherman@theburrd.com:~

        This will move trasfer the tar ball to the home directory on the
        remote server.


3. SSH into the server and locate the newly transfered bundle.  Unzip the tar
        ball using the command:

        $> tar -xvf burrd-website.tar.gz

        A new directory called bundle should have been created.


4. Move into the bundle directory.  Change the directory to:
        bundle/programs/server


5. Run the command:

        $> sudo npm install


6. To test deployment of the website, change to the top level bundle
	directory and run the command:

        $> env PORT=80 MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/burrd-website ROOT_URL=http://theburrd.com node main.js


        Note: The two following commands may be needed to open port 80.

        $> sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
        $> sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\``


7. The website can be deployed and run consistently using npm forever.  From
	the home directory, run the command:

	$> forever start bundle/main.js
